Feature: Hypothesis list feature
  As a student
  I want to view the hypothesis list of an exercise

  Scenario: Student can view the hypothesis list of an exercise
    Given I have logged in as a student
    And some hypotheses have been added to case
    When I visit the "Ty√∂hypoteesit" page of the case "Lihanautakuolemat"
    Then the page should have buttons
      | Nautaflunssa |
      | Hevosheikkous |


  Scenario: Unchecked hypotheses will be in alphabetical order
    Given I have logged in as a student
    And there is an exercise that has multiple hypotheses
    And I go to the hypothesis list of that exercise
    Then the hypothesis list should be in alphabetical order

  Scenario: Checked hypotheses will be in alphabetical order
    Given I have logged in as a student
    And there is an exercise that has multiple hypotheses
    And those hypotheses are all checked
    And I go to the hypothesis list of that exercise
    Then the hypothesis list should be in alphabetical order
